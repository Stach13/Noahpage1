        <actions e="1">Even now that we are out of sight of land,</actions>
        <feelings n="1">it seems impossible</feelings>
        <actions e="2"> that I am actually off to France and, for the first time in my life,
            traveling alone.</actions>
        <actions e="3">Everything has happened so quickly since the</actions>
        <acronym>American Fund for French Wounded</acronym>
        <abbr>A.F.F.W</abbr> 
        <actions e="4">found an opening for me in Paris that I suppose I am still somewhat</actions>
        <feelings n="2">dazed and bewildered.</feelings>
        <feelings n="3">The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and that I can't look
            ahead makes it easier to be happy and live in the present.</feelings>
        <line>Of course I have had a bit of a taste in New York of the work that the A. F.
            F. W. is doing but its Headquarters in Paris will be different in some ways I
            fancy.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <feelings n="4">I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few
            girls of my age are getting across,</feelings>
        <feelings n="5">and I understood the grit and pluck which made you encourage me on my great
            adventure</feelings>
        <line>andb send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of late.</line>
    </p>
    <p>
        <actions e="5">As we drifted down the river, in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing
            alongside,</actions>
        <description>I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our
            minds.</description>
        <line>"How many 
            of this ship's company will see that sky-line again!"</line>
        <actions e="6">It was very quiet, no one spoke much, and, little by little, the glow faded
            from the sky and one star after another appeared.</actions>
        <feelings n="6">I knew that you would be looking at those same stars down in Lakewood and
            that your thoughts and prayers were the same that filled my heart at that moment.
            Somehow distance does not separate, after all.</feelings>
    </p>
    <p>
        <actions e="7">We waited near the Statue of Liberty until midnight—a rumor had it that a
            "personage" was to come on board. </actions>
        <line>This individual was shrouded in mystery until we put to sea when it was given out
            that the party which had clambered aboard in the night was none other than the Italian
            Mission.</line>

        <actions e="8">We waited near the Statue of Liberty until midnight—a rumor had it that a
            "personage" was to come on board.</actions>
        <description>This individual was shrouded in mystery until we put to sea when it was given
            out that the party which had clambered aboard in the night was none other than the
            Italian Mission. </description>
        <feelings n="7">Our spirits rose at once for,</feelings>
        <line>what with Frank Sayre on the boat and these distinguished Italian gentlemen, we shall
            doubtless be honored by a bigger convoy and so doubly safe.</line>
        <actions e="9">However, thus far we have but two destroyers following us. They can be seen
            distinctly outlined against the horizon, one on each side, and seem to be the same
            somber gray which all ships are affecting in this war. </actions>
        <actions e="10">A sailor informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the
            first four or five days </actions>
        <feelings n="8">but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's hoping!</feelings>
    </p>
    <p>
        <line>I have a small inside cabin and my room-mate is quite a character. She is a
            native of Haiti, voluble and very portly—has four large pieces of baggage in our tiny
            stateroom, wears a costume which resembles a Mother Hubbard and smokes countless thin
            cigarettes that smell like incense!</line>
        <actions e="11">When I appeared, there didn't seem to be much room for me but, as she says,
            luckily I am small, and I was soon tucked into the upper berth with my belongings! </actions>
        <line>She really isn't bad and after looking me over carefully told me that she didn't
            think we would fight and from that time has beamed upon me!</line>
        <actions e="12">She is going over to join her son who has been fighting with the French
            since the beginning of the war but will never go back to the Front now, having lost some
            fingers off each hand.</actions>
        <feelings n="9">She is so thankful, she says, that he hasn't lost more than his fingers.
