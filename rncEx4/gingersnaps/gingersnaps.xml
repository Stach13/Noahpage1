<title>Gingersnaps</title>

<body>These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home dunked in tea, coffee, or milk, and frequently enjoyed during the November/December holiday season. But they're just as welcome on a mellow, golden, late-September afternoon, with a comfortable lounge chair and a large glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade.</body>

<measurement fraction="1" i="12">1 teaspoon cinnamon</measurement>

<title>Instructions</title>

<step overview="1">Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.</step>

<step overview="2">Beat together the shortening, sugar, salt, and baking soda.</step>

<step overview="3">Beat in the egg, then the molasses.</step>

<step overview="4">Add the flour and spices, beating to make a smooth, fairly stiff dough.</step>

<step overview="5">To make the coating, combine the sugar and cinnamon, and place in a shallow pan or dish.</step>

<step overview="6">Drop the dough in 1" balls into the cinnamon-sugar mixture; a teaspoon cookie scoop is perfect here.</step>

<step overview="7">Roll the balls in the sugar to coat, then transfer them to the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1/2" between them; they'll spread as they bake.</step>

<step overview="8">Bake the cookies for 11 minutes, for cookies that are crisp around the edges, and "bendy" in the center. Bake for 13 minutes, for cookies that are crisp/crunchy all the way through.</step>

<step overview="9">Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the pan, or on a rack. Cool completely, then store tightly wrapped, at room temperature.</step>
